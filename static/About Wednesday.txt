Who is Wednesday Addams?

Wednesday Addams (Ricci) is the eldest daughter of Gomez (Raul Julia) and Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston). She’s close to the family butler Lurch (Carel Struycken).
Wednesday harbors a love of all things macabre, and is especially fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle.
She also admires her ancestor, Great Aunt Calpurnia Addams, who was burned alive as a witch in the 18th century.
In Addams Family Values Wednesday buried a cat alive, tried to murder her brother Pubert and may have scared her boyfriend to death.
In short, she’s a girl who’s one with the forces of darkness.
Why She Matters:
Alright, so why does Wednesday Addams matter? She represents individuality, for starters. Wednesday embraces who she is through and through. She’s comfortable in her own skin. Wednesday will never sacrifice her beliefs or her sense of self for anyone. She is a prime example of loving yourself without inhibitions. Wednesday is a strong individual, and damn anyone who tries to bring her down. She has her own voice, and she’s unafraid to use it.
Not only that, but Wednesday doesn’t “live” for romance or having a boyfriend. This is also imperative for young girls to witness – that establishing your identity in a partner is detrimental to your own character. It hurts more than it helps. Life is rife with endless possibilities, and we should all focus more on seeking out the best it has to offer.
So, be like Wednesday. Be true to yourself. When everyone else jumps off a bridge, stay on it. March to the beat of your own dirge. Be inquisitive. Embrace your inner goth child. Oh, and try not to kill your brother…if you can help it.
