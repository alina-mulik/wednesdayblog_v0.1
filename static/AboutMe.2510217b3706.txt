Who is Wednesday Addams?
Wednesday is originally a pale, dark-haired, grim-looking little girl who is fascinated with death and the macabre.
She rarely smiles. Wednesday's favorite toy is her Marie Antoinette doll, which her brother guillotines (at her request).
Wednesday is deceptively strong; she is able to bring her father down with a judo hold.
